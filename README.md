# Mission repository proof of concept

Each folder contains a mission -- readme.md contains info about the mission (including markdown version of the brief?) along with any supporting files such as briefing slide decks and kneeboards.

.miz themselves added as a github "release", then link the release download link for the .miz to the mission readme.
